# PosgreSQL-challenge

In the present project we utilize PostgreSQL to create a schema for a relatiaonal database on historic employee data from a company throughout the 70's to 90's. The schema and data loading script is attached in the present repository. Following that, we executed a series of queries to the databse to test the database sanity. 
The current software versions utilized are: pgAdmin 4 and Postgresql 13.
